        Hello! I'm Inna Visotskaya, a software developer passionate about
        building scalable and impactful applications. Currently pursuing a
        Bachelor’s in Computer Science at UNC Charlotte, I specialize in
        software engineering, AI, and cloud computing. I'm constantly
        exploring new technologies and love the process of solving complex
        problems with code.

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
      I graduated with an Associate of Arts in Computer Science from Central Piedmont Community College and am currently
      completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at UNC Charlotte. Some of the key subjects I've focused on
      include Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, and Algorithms. These areas fuel my
      passion for developing intelligent systems and building cloud-based solutions.
    </p>
    <h3>Skills I've mastered</h3>
    <p>Languages & Frameworks: Python, JavaScript, Node.js, EJS, CSS, HTML, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, SQL
      Technologies: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Terraform, Git, Vite, Apigee
      Software Engineering: Full-stack development, Agile methodologies, Cloud computing
      Other: Problem-solving, Team collaboration, Adaptability, Communication</p>
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    During my recent internship at Ally Financial, I developed an AI prediction service using Python and Node.js, which
    helped reduce call center volume. I also implemented serverless data processing pipelines and deployed cloud
    infrastructure using AWS and Terraform. My experience in Agile environments with Jira has helped me work efficiently
    in cross-functional teams, and I’m excited to bring these skills to my future projects.
    <h3>My Passions</h3>
    <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, taking photos for my church, or experimenting
      with new baking recipes.</p>
